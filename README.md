# Web Accessify
Welcome to the Web Accessify GitHub repository! This repository contains the source code for various components of the Web Accessify accessibility solution. It is organized into three main folders:

# 1. webaccessify-portfolio
The webaccessify-portfolio folder contains the website for Web Accessify. This is the public-facing website that showcases the features, benefits, and testimonials related to our accessibility solution. It provides information and resources for individuals and organizations interested in improving web accessibility.

To set up and run the website locally, follow the instructions provided in the webaccessify-portfolio folder's README file.

# 2. client-dashboard
The client-dashboard folder contains the client dashboard for Web Accessify. This dashboard is designed for our clients, where they can log in, manage their account, access relevant information, and customize the accessibility widget for their websites.

To set up and run the client dashboard locally, follow the instructions provided in the client-dashboard folder's README file. It may require additional dependencies and configurations.

# 3. backend-server
The backend-server folder contains the Node.js and Express.js server for Web Accessify. This server handles various backend functionalities, such as user authentication, API integrations, and data storage. It serves as the backbone for both the webaccessify-portfolio and client-dashboard components.

To set up and run the backend server locally, follow the instructions provided in the backend-server folder's README file. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies and configure any environment variables as instructed.
